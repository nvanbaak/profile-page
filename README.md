# Portfolio

## Overview

This my a professional portfolio, [deployed on GitHub](https://nvanbaak.github.io/profile-page/) until I get around to hosting it on my Raspberry Pi.

Current contents:

* A home page with an About Me section
* A Portfolio page with selected projects

##  Responsive Web Design

A key objective for this project was making the web pages mobile-responsive.  This mattered most in two cases: the collapsible navbar, and the porfolio page.

### Collapsing navbar

<img src="./Assets/Images/navbar-fullsize.png" alt="navbar at full size">

<img src="./Assets/Images/navbar-responsive.png" alt="navbar is collapsed">

### Responsive Portfolio

<img src="./Assets/Images/portfolio-wide.png" alt="two columns at full width">

<img src="./Assets/Images/portfolio-responsive.png" alt="one column in smaller widths">
